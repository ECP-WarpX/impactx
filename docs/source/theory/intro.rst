Assumptions
-----------

This is a work-in-progress list of physical assumptions implemented in the numerics of ImpactX.


Tracking and Lattice Optics
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* **velocity spread:** when solving space-charge effects, we assume that the relative spread of velocities of particles in the beam is negligible compared to the velocity of the reference particle


Space Charge (Poisson Solver)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* **electrostatic in the bunch frame:** we assume there are no retardation effects
