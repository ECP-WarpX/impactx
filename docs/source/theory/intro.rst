Assumptions
-----------

This is a work-in-progress list of physical assumptions implemented in the numerics of ImpactX:

* **quasi-electrostatic:** we assume there are retardation effects

* **longitudinal velocity spread:** when solving space-charge effects, we assume that the relative spread of velocities of particles in the beam is negligible compared to the velocity of the reference particle
