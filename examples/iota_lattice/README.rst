.. _examples-iotalattice:

The "bare" linear lattice of the Fermilab IOTA storage ring
===========================================================

The linear lattice of the IOTA storage ring, configured for operation with a 2.5 MeV proton beam.

The drift regions available for insertion of the special nonlinear magnetic element for integrable optics experiments are denoted ``dnll``.

The second moments of the particle distribution after a single turn should coincide with the initial secton moments of the particle distribution, to within the level expected due to numerical particle noise.

In this test, the initial and final values of :math:`\sigma_x`, :math:`\sigma_y`, :math:`\sigma_t`, :math:`\epsilon_x`, :math:`\epsilon_y`, and :math:`\eepsilon_t` must agree with nominal values.


Run
---

This example an either be run with an inputs file (``impactx input_iotalattice.in``):

.. literalinclude:: input_iotalattice.in
   :language: ini
   :caption: You can copy this file from ``examples/iota_lattice/input_iotalattice.in``.

Or as a Python script (``python3 run_iotalattice.py``):

.. literalinclude:: run_iotalattice.py
   :language: python3
   :caption: You can copy this file from ``examples/iota_lattice/run_iotalattice.py``.

Both execution modes can also be prefixed with an MPI executor, such as ``mpiexec -n 4 ...`` or ``srun -n 4 ...``, depending on the system.
