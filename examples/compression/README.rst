Ballistic Compression Using a Short RF Element
==============================================

A 20 MeV electron beam propagates through a short RF element near zero-crossing, inducing a head-tail energy correlation.
This is followed by ballistic motion in a drift, which is used to compress the rms bunch length from 16 ps to 10 ps (compression of 5/3).

The beam is not exactly on-crest (phase = -89.5 deg), so there is an energy gain of 4.5 MeV.

The transverse emittance is sufficiently small that the horizontal and verticle beam size are essentially unchanged.  Due to RF curvature, there is some growth of the longitudinal emittance.

In this test, the initial and final values of :math:`\sigma_x`, :math:`\sigma_y`, :math:`\sigma_t`, :math:`\epsilon_x`, :math:`\epsilon_y`, and :math:`\epsilon_t` must agree with nominal values.


Run
---

This example can be run as a Python script (``python3 run_compression.py``) or with an app with an input file (``impactx input_compression.in``).
Each can also be prefixed with an `MPI executor <https://www.mpi-forum.org>`__, such as ``mpiexec -n 4 ...`` or ``srun -n 4 ...``, depending on the system.
